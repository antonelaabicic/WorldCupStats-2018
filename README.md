<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project involves creating three interconnected applications to display statistics from the 2018 Men's and 2019 Women's World Cup using a specific API. 

The **Data Layer (Class Library)** is responsible for retrieving, parsing, and mapping data from the API or JSON files, preparing it for use in both client applications, and saving or reading the data from text files for offline use. 

The **Windows Forms application** provides a user interface where users can select preferences, such as gender priority and language, pick a favorite national team and top players, and view rankings of players and matches. The application includes drag-and-drop functionality for managing favorite players and supports printing rankings as PDFs. 

The **WPF application** offers a responsive, modern interface, allowing users to change display settings and see visualized team lineups on a football field background. It includes features like animated player information display, match result overviews, and customization of window resolution settings. 

Both applications rely on the shared Data Layer for data manipulation, enabling a consistent and efficient experience across both platforms.
